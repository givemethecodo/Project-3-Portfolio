    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Erika Hance</p>
    <img src="../img/profpic.jpg" alt="Erika Hance" class="">
    <p>I am an Indigenous-Canadian freelance illustrator and game artist based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
      I have a fondness for crafting cute and colourful visual identities, especially while designing characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cute designs have more power than we give them credit for: they bring positivity to their viewers and they
      make brands more approachable and memorable. I am a firm believer that design should inspire strong emotions.
      After all, designing is a human-centric craft. Since spreading joy is my passion, I use my proficiency in
      Clip Studio Paint, Paint Tool SAI, Procreate, Pixaki and Adobe Suite Software to create cute designs that do just that.
      I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I have worked on titles like Grooveyard (not yet released),
      and many individual projects.
