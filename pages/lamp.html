        <h2>LAMP!: Designing ‘Moth-thew’</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="space-between">
          “LAMP!” is an endless obstacle-dodging Unity game that I made in a team. It features a moth,
          who dodges rainfall and other obstacles to reach his goal: the light of a lamp. We defined our
          target audience as young, casual players who like to explore and fantasise. The project task
          was to redesign a very rudimentary game within three iterations. I was the art lead and sole illustrator.
        </p>
        <p class="space-between">
          The problems with the original were endless: the game was coded with many errors,
          the gameplay was too repetitive and simple, and the graphics were unappealing. However, as the illustrator of the game,
          I was mostly focused on the graphics. In particular the design of the main enemy: the original enemy graphics featured
          realistic depictions of an antlion.
         </p>

      <div class="row">
        <p class="space-between">
          Our group found the antlion unattractive and inappropriate for most audiences. We tried ideating to make the antlion cuter. Taking info from characters in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, our character would have simpler shapes and more curves instead of sharp edges.

      <div class="row">
        <p class="space-between">
          When we decided to code an endless obstacle-dodging game, the team felt that an antlion was too obscure and wanted to change our main character to be a more recognizable insect.

        <p class="space-between">
          At the time, Vancouver was experiencing a whole horde of moths. We decided to be topical and make our character a moth. This is how ‘Moth-thew’ came to be. In this stage, the moth was a tad too simple. But I got what I was looking for, the colour scheme and general shape was well-received. I was told to add a pattern, so I did and sent it to the team for feedback.
        </p>

        <p class="space-between">
          For this final design, I brought back the use of rounded shapes to make the character shape language as clearly friendly as possible: most notably, I rounded out the body fur. The pointed antennae are to give the character a more distinct silhouette. Finally the pattern was used to break up the monotony of a singular colour and differentiate Moth-thew from being perceived as a butterfly. This was the design used for the final.
        </p>

      <div class="row">
        <p class="space-between">
          Shape language and silhouette are two of the most pivotal parts in character design. By keeping these concepts in mind, I created a friendly-looking insect with a cheerful colour palette that contrasts against the blue background of our game.
