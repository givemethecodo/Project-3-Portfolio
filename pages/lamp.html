    <h1>LAMP!: Designing ‘Moth-thew’</h1>
    <p>“LAMP!” is an endless obstacle-dodging Unity game that I made in a team. It features a moth,
      who dodges rainfall and other obstacles to reach his goal: the light of a lamp. We defined our
       target audience as young, casual players who like to explore and fantasise. The project task
       was to redesign a very rudimentary game within three iterations. I was the art lead and sole illustrator.
    </p>
    <p>The problems with the original were endless: the game was coded with many errors,
      the gameplay was too repetitive and simple, and the graphics were unappealing. However, as the illustrator of the game,
       I was mostly focused on the graphics. In particular the design of the main enemy: the original enemy graphics featured
       realistic depictions of an antlion.

    <p>I am an Indigenous-Canadian freelance illustrator and game artist based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
      I have a fondness for crafting cute and colourful visual identities, especially while designing characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cute designs have more power than we give them credit for: they bring positivity to their viewers and they
      make brands more approachable and memorable. I am a firm believer that design should inspire strong emotions.
      After all, designing is a human-centric craft. Since spreading joy is my passion, I use my proficiency in
      Clip Studio Paint, Paint Tool SAI, Procreate, Pixaki and Adobe Suite Software to create cute designs that do just that.
      I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I have worked on titles like Grooveyard (not yet released),
      and many individual projects.
